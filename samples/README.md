# Coding Samples

Small samples from various programming/markup/config languages to check how Catppuccin looks on them. In the scenario
where you need samples from a wider set of languages, please look towards [kate-editor.org](kate-editor.org/syntax).

# Acknowledgement

These samples were taken from [JetBrains Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)'s syntax highlighting tools.
