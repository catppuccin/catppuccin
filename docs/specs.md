### Palettes

Catppuccin consists of four named color palettes: Latte, Frappe, Macchiato, and Mocha. Each palette has its use-cases and a reason to exist! (so to speak). Every palette has labels (AKA colors) that provide different syntactic meanings and color effects for dark & bright ambiance designs. Each one of them was created aiming for a clear, uncluttered, and elegant design following a minimal and flat style pattern.

### Subpalettes

Every palette consists of two subpalettes: one monochromatic and one analogous. The Monochromatic subpalette consists of different shades of a purple-gray and a very pale lavender and is often used for UI components. Whereas the Analogous palette has every color in the rainbow and is often used for syntactic elements.
