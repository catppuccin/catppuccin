### Palette

Catppuccin consists of four named flavors: Latte, Frapp√©, Macchiato, and Mocha. Each flavor has its use-cases
and a reason to exist! (so to speak). Every flavor has labels (AKA colors) that provide different syntactic meanings
and color effects for dark & bright ambiance designs. Each one of them was created aiming for a clear, uncluttered, and
elegant design following a minimal and flat style pattern.

&nbsp;

### Sub-palettes

Every flavor consists of two sub-palettes: one monochromatic and one analogous. The monochromatic sub-palette consists
of different shades of a purple-gray and a very pale lavender and is often used for UI components. Whereas the analogous
palette has every color in the rainbow and is often used for syntactic elements.
