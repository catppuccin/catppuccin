	Guidelines for submitting and creating ports 
</p>

&nbsp;

### What's a port?

A port is an adaptation of Catppuccin's palette for an app to use. Think of it as a colorscheme for a program
that styles every UI component it consists of!

&nbsp;

### Submission

Raise a discussion under main
repository [here!](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/discussions/new?category=port-requests) The title should be
the **simplest** name of the application/tool/website/etc that you are wanting ported over.

If you have already created a repository containing the work, make sure to include it within the description for others
to see! Feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r6Mdz5dpFc) and share it there too!

The discussion will be transferred to an issue by
the [staff team](https://github.com/orgs/catppuccin/teams/staff/members) once we have deemed the port ready to be
reviewed and merged!

All ports should conform to our [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/catppuccin/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and we, the staff team, reserve the right to choose what ports will be included under the organisation. As a
community-driven project, we want to keep a neutral environment for all users. Therefore, **we do not accept
contributions that have a religious or political context.** However, we have no issue with our palette being used in
these contexts.

&nbsp;

### Creation

You can create ports using [this](https://github.com/catppuccin/template) public template as a blueprint.

1. Clone template repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/catppuccin/template.git <name_of_your_port>
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository

    ```
    cd <name_of_your_port>
    ```

3. Delete the existing remote

    ```
    git remote remove origin
    ```

4. Set up the rest of your port, and push it to your user repository!

&nbsp;

### Licensing

Any contribution will be published under the same licensing terms as the project itself. However, there
are [exceptions to this rule](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acatppuccin+-license%3Amit). Please get in touch with us
if that is the case with your work!

&nbsp;

### Styling!

After creating the repo successfully, it's important to style it properly to ensure consistency:

- The name of the repo must be the simplest version of the app's name (e.g. `nvim` instead of `NeoVim`). You may use
  hyphens if needed (e.g. `windows-files`).
- Put the images under `assets/`.
- Format the repo's description as "`<emoji>` Soothing pastel theme for `<app name>`".
  - `<emoji>` should be an emoji that you feel represents the app best.
  - `<app name>` is the name of the app, capitalized properly.
- Add `catppuccin`, and `theme` to the topics.
- Ensure uppercase meta files (e.g. `README.md`)
- Don't add health files (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`), those are organization-wide files
  stored [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/.github).

&nbsp;

### Tools

Since Catppuccin is available in 4 flavors it's understandable that it may be difficult to make 4 versions of a
port. So to help with that, we have built a bunch of tools to make life easier when creating Catppuccin ports. You'll
find them all (with instructions) under our [catppuccin/toolbox](https://github.com/catppuccin/toolbox) repo.
An essential tool for creating ports is [catwalk](https://github.com/catppuccin/toolbox#catwalk), this is used to create
a layered screenshot of your port which combines all four flavors into one.
